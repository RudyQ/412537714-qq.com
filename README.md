# InverseFaceRender
This is tensorflow code for our project: Learning Inverse Rendering of Faces from Real-world Videos. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12047)
Currently we release our test code and pretrained models. 
The file 'isa_test' is for the models with IlluRes module and 'sa_test' for those without the specific module.

The models could be downloaded at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Q2DUZ0LHqZSV_rCZKA2bKa9qtEr9GAki.
